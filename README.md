# Building a Microservices Architecture with Django and RabbitMQ
A simple application built using Django, structured with a microservices architecture pattern. The primary goal is to demonstrate how to design and implement a scalable and modular system by breaking down functionalities into independent services.

# Features:
- Django Backend: Utilizes Django to handle core functionalities and serve as the main application framework.
- Microservices Design: Implements a microservices architecture to separate concerns and promote modularity.
- Scalability: Focuses on building scalable services that can be independently deployed, managed, and scaled.
- API Endpoints: Defines RESTful API endpoints for communication between different microservices.
- Database Integration: Integrates with a database system to persist data and maintain consistency across services.
- Containerization: Utilizes containerization techniques (e.g., Docker) to package each microservice and simplify deployment.
- Orchestration: Includes orchestration tools or platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) to manage and coordinate multiple services efficiently.
